                    <p>I'd like to be known as a web developer who writes clean maintainable code and works as a team player 
                    making a sufficient salary and be recognized by my employer as a valuable asset to the company I work for.
                    I'd prefer to work for a company that specializes in development rather than a company with just a "software guy".</p>

                    <p>Throughout the program I plan to utilize my current skills and have the ability to adapt them to my work environment, 
                    stay on top of my skills by keeping up with growing changes and the most efficient practices.</p>

                    <p>During my education at Bryan University, I plan to give my best effort in understanding what is being taught regardless of what I already know.
                    I've enjoyed learning Flexbox with grid and @media queries the most in this course.</p>

                    <p>Before "Mobile First" I remember development was a little teadous to support all 3 environments.
                    I've learned how grid and flexbox makes design and placement of content a lot more practical especially designing with the mobile first technique.
                    I used to get a little frustrated with CSS when I was tasked to work with it.
                    I feel a lot more comfortable now with what I've learned and I have a better understanding now after completing the course.
                    I've gained confidence in knowing the basic importance of why HTML5 was introduced and why CSS is powerful in designing high quality web sites/applications.</p>
                    
                    <p>Now going forward in my career, I am confident I have the basic understanding of Cascading Style Sheets.
                    I look forward to learning even more in depth concepts to become a developer with a  broader range of skills.</p>
